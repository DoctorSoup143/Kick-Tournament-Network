                <h4>About</h4>
                <p class="lead mb-4">The Kill Confirmed tournament is an intense solo competition that brings together 12 skilled participants, each with the goal of scoring points by successfully taking down other PMCs and exfiltrating with the armband within the opposite colored enemy team's backpack. To add to the challenge, SCAVs will spawn during the event, making it even more difficult for competitors to survive and traverse locations quietly. Half of the competitors will wear a red armband and the other will wear a blue armband. The team who extracts with the most armbands from the enemy team wins that round. Teams will be randomly assigned when the competitor list is released. Despite the competition's nature, the rules are relatively simple. There are minimal restrictions on ammo, armor, weapons, and attachments, allowing competitors to choose the gear they feel most comfortable using. This means that participants will have to rely on their personal skills, strategy, and tactics to secure a win.
                    <br /><br />
                    In addition to the previous information, it should be noted that killing a member of the same team will result in a penalty of minus 1 point. Therefore, competitors must exercise caution and precision when aiming at targets. All competitors must wear their team's armband and have an identical armband in their backpack.
                    <br /><br />
                    Also, it is worth mentioning that the first six competitors in the list will be part of the red team, while the remaining six will be part of the blue team. This arrangement ensures a fair distribution of skilled individuals among the teams, enhancing the competition's competitiveness.
                    <br /><br />
                    Note: This is a Customs only event.
                    <br /><br />
                    Note: Players may <b>NOT</b> use Secure Containers of <b>ANY</b> type in this event.
                    <br />

                <h4>Ammunition</h4>
                <p class="lead mb-4">To safeguard the overall viewing experience and elevate the significance of headshots, we have enforced restrictions on ammunition. By limiting the use of certain ammunition, players are encouraged to engage in longer and more calculated combat scenarios. This promotes a more thoughtful and methodical approach to the game, as players must rely on their skill and positioning rather than relying solely on powerful ammunition. Skilled positioning and strategic tactics become more valuable in this environment, allowing players to earn their victories through well-executed plans and careful gameplay. These restrictions not only promote a more challenging and immersive experience but also add an extra layer of depth and strategy to the gameplay. Overall, the intention of these restrictions is to create a more engaging and rewarding experience for players who are willing to put in the effort and skill required to succeed. All restricted and allowed ammunition is viewable on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pEBjtNPWuJEMj-IfZ4oI43gmEPlOYVUfG19XE7xGQ_A/edit?usp=sharing">this spreadsheet</a>.

                <h4>Attachments</h4>
                <p class="lead mb-4">To establish a balanced and equitable gaming environment, we have implemented limitations on thermal sights and UBGLs. This guarantees that all PMCs must depend on their expertise and abilities to identify and eliminate potential dangers. Participants will not be permitted to rely on an attachment to perform this task for them.

                <p class="lead col-md-12">To uphold the integrity of the tournament, we have implemented restrictions on the consumption of stimulants by players. The list of approved stimulants is limited to those specified below, and there are restrictions in place to ensure that players still face the effects of stamina depletion, the need to use medkits, and are motivated to play in a more realistic and conservative manner. Please refer to the approved stimulants and their corresponding limitations outlined below for more information. Players may take stimulants off of bodies without restriction.
